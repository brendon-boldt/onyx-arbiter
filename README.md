Automated Class Scheduler

This project was created for the purpose of implementing automated scheduling for classes in a high school environment.

As of now, the project contains a structure of classes, teachers, students, et cetera; the project lacks a strong scheduling algorithm and currently uses a combination of brute force and a pseudo random number generator. The imperfections in the created schedules are still too high to be effective. A more complex algorithm is needed for plausible use.
